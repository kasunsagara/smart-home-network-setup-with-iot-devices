<h1>Smart Home Network Setup with IoT Devices</h1>  
<h3>An intelligent, secure, and user-controlled home automation network</h3>  
<br>

<h1>Project Description</h1>

<p>
This project presents a complete <b>Smart Home Network Setup</b> designed and implemented using 
<b>Cisco Packet Tracer</b>. The main focus of this project is to <b>connect multiple IoT devices</b> 
to a home network and allow users to <b>control these devices (ON/OFF)</b> through 
<b>mobile phones and tablets</b>. The system demonstrates how smart home devices can be centrally 
managed and remotely controlled using user-friendly interfaces.
</p>
<br>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>
The smart home network is designed to support real-world home automation scenarios, including:<br><br>
• Connecting IoT devices to a wireless home network<br>
• Turning smart devices ON and OFF remotely<br>
• Controlling devices using smartphones and tablets<br>
• Monitoring home environment through sensors<br><br>

A home gateway acts as the central controller, enabling seamless communication between IoT devices
and user devices such as PCs, tablets, and mobile phones. This setup reflects how modern smart homes
operate in practice.

</p>
<br>

<h1>Features</h1>

<p>
• Wireless connection of IoT devices to the home network<br>
• Smart appliances and sensors integrated into the system<br>
• ON/OFF control of IoT devices (lights, fans, doors, etc.)<br>
• Device control using tablets and smartphones<br>
• Centralized home gateway for device management<br>
• Secure Wi-Fi access for user devices<br>
• Internet connectivity via cloud simulation<br>
</p>
<br>

<h1>Network Topology</h1>

<p>
The network topology simulates a real smart home environment with:<br><br>
• Home gateway / wireless router<br>
• IoT devices connected to the gateway<br>
• Smart sensors and actuators<br>
• User devices such as PCs, tablets, and smartphones<br>
• Internet cloud for remote access and control<br><br>

This topology allows users to manage and control IoT devices in real time using their personal
mobile or tablet devices.

</p>
<br>

<h1>Objectives</h1>

<p>
• Demonstrate IoT device connectivity in a smart home<br>
• Enable ON/OFF control of smart devices<br>
• Show mobile and tablet-based device management<br>
• Practice home networking concepts using Packet Tracer<br>
• Simulate a functional smart home environment<br>
</p>
<br>

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>

<p>
• Cisco Packet Tracer<br>
• Home Gateway and Wireless Router<br>
• IoT devices and smart sensors<br>
• Smartphones and tablets for device control<br>
• DHCP and basic IP addressing<br>
• Secure Wi-Fi (WPA2/WPA3)<br>
</p>
<br>

<h1>About This Project</h1>

<p>
This project is created for educational purposes to demonstrate how IoT devices can be connected, 
controlled, and managed within a smart home network. Users can interact with smart devices directly 
through tablets and mobile phones, making the system practical, interactive, and easy to use. 
The project can be expanded by adding advanced automation rules, voice control, or enhanced security 
features.
